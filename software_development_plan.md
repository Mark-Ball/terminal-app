#Statement of Purpose and Scope

Discover Your Spirit Animal is a terminal application which assesses the user's personality type by asking the user  questions and then informs the user which animal they are similar to and which personality attributes they share with the animal. 

The problem this application will solve is to provide personality information to people who are too time-poor to complete academic personality testing such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which can involve 100-200 questions and take over 30 minutes to complete. Discover Your Spirit Animal also offers a fun alternative to these other personality assessments, which may seem disinteresting to some. The reason for the development of Discover Your Spirit Animal is to allow users to learn about themselves and consider how their behaviour may be regarded by others.

The target audience for Discover Your Spirit Animal is people who enjoy taking online quizzes to learn more about their personality but are too time-poor to complete longer personality assessments. Secondly, the application is also for people who are disinterested in participating in an academic personality assessment and prefer a fun alternative. Lastly, the application is for people who do not wish to pay for their personality assessment. The target audience will prefer Discover Your Spirit Animal to other personality assessments available online due to the speed with which they can complete the quiz, the fun questions, and because it is free to take.

The application will function by presenting the user with a scenario and asking what they would do. Available options will be displayed and the user will be asked to input their choice into the terminal. After inputting their choice to the scenario, the next scenario will be presented. This process will repeat until all questions have been asked and the program will then output to the screen which animal has a similar personality to, as well as a paragraph explaining these personality characteristics.
