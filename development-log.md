Day 2, 04/09/2019
The goals for today were:
1. Complete all basic features listed on the software development plan, complete manual testing of these features, and correct any errors.

This was completed and manual testing uncovered multiple bugs, which were subsequently corrected. The current iteration of the software has passed all manual tests.

2. Complete the User experience section of the software development plan. This section had not been completed prior to this point because a prototype of the application was required to describe what the user would see on the screen when they use the application.

No blockers for these goals were anticipated.
